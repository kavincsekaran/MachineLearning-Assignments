    Problem 1: Multi-armed bandit problem 
    In this problem, you will implement an AI player for Multi-armed bandit problem epsilon-greedy method.
    The main goal of this problem is to get familiar with a simplified problem in reinforcement learning, and how to train the model parameters on the data from a game.
    You could test the correctness of your code by typing `nosetests test1.py` in the terminal.
